          <br> I'm going to give a disclaimer with these and say that if you don't like 
          oatmeal cookies or walnuts you will not enjoy these. They're also entirely a 
          labor of love and I spilled oats all over my apartment while making these. I ate 
          more of this dough than I did any previous cookie. I am also biased because these 
          are the cookies my mom made for me growing up. </br>
          <b> Texture:</b> 10/10 (solid yet chewy in the center) <br />
           <b> Flavor: </b> 10/10 (the mix of the oatmeal and chocolate and walnut is too good) <br />
          <b> Ease of recipe:</b> 6/10 (these are the first cookies I didn't have to chill, howver they do involve grinding the oats in a food processor and toasting nuts in a pan which is not necessarily easy. Also hand grating a chocolate bar is hard and messy work and I grates of a chunk of my newly painted finger nails so that sucked.) <br />
          <b> Overall: </b> 9/10 (these are a time commitment but oh my god. They are so good.) <br />
